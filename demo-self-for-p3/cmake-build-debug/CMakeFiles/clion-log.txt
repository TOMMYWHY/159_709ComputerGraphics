CMake Warning at external/assimp/CMakeLists.txt:309 (FIND_PACKAGE):
  By not providing "FindDirectX.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "DirectX", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "DirectX" with any
  of the following names:

    DirectXConfig.cmake
    directx-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "DirectX" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "DirectX_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "DirectX" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.

CMake Error at external/assimp/CMakeLists.txt:343 (use_pkgconfig):
